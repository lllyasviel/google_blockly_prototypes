### Google Blockly Prototypes

Some of our projects will begin to use **Google Blockly** as a prototyping tool for certain developments. This approach is aimed at enhancing the speed and flexibility of experimental feature creation.

- **Experimental Prototype**: Some projects may store experimental Visual Programming Graphs (VPGs) directly in Google Blockly specifications within the `google_blockly` folder.
- **Mature Code**: Once code has matured and proven its stability, it may be rewritten in Python and moved to its appropriate directory, if necessary.
